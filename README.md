Changes to spectral information of buildings after collapse due to earthquake.

As an exploratory analysis, I have compared the spectral information of the collapsed buildings in Mexico City before and after the earthquake occurred in September 2017. There were around 19 buildings that verified as total collapsed after the earthquake in Mexico City. Two images have been linked to this application that first one shows the boxplots of “band5” reflectance of 19 different buildings that were collapsed due to the earthquake (this type of figure is available for all other spectral bands as well). As can be seen, the band 5 spectral information for each building has dramatically change due to the earthquake, which shows the high potential of this parameter for distinguishing the collapsed buildings from intact ones. Same scenario is true for all other image bands; for example, in the second image linked to this application, the boxplot of all spectral bands for one of the collapsed building has been shown. As can be seen, for a collapsed building, spectral information associated with each image’s bands have been hugely changed. This shows the promising potential of the spectral information of an image to be used as parameters for predicting whether a building has been collapsed due to the earthquake or remained intact.
